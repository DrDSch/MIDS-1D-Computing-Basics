## MIDS Computing Basics Bridge Class

In the MIDS program we teach concepts and tools around data science and machine learning. While we offer our students introductory classes for Python and Statistics, we cannot deliver basic computation skills that are usually taught in a full Bachelor program CS. To cover this gap this bridge course gives resources to learn the most important concepts and tools required to successfully complete the MIDS program.

### Goals and Objectives
This course has the objective to give resources for self learning and test the studentsâ€™ skill level in the end. Students who already know the content can skip ahead to the tests. 
Objectives of this course:
* Acquire basic knowledge/terminology about:
* Operating systems
* Computer Networks
* LINUX
* Learn basics of important tools:
* Linux command line
* Git and GitHub
* Shell scripting

### How to use this course:
This course guides you through a series of FREE online classes. For example in EDX you can select the Audit only option, 
the paid certificate is not necessary. After each external course please come back to this document and find a link to a test, 
follow the instructions given to prove completion of the course. Alternatively you can prove your knowledge through having finished 
a CS undergrad or corresponding work experience.

### Operating systems
Understanding how a computer works and the role of the Operating System is the basis for any work with cloud technology and distributed computing as is the standard for many big data and machine learning approaches.

The following course is offered through EDX and was created by NYU:

### Networking 

Understanding how computers communicate with each other is a basic concept necessary to work with cloud tech, multi container setups, 
and more. Networking comes in two parts. The following EDX course, again from NYU, covers an overview of the network stack. 
We will later revisit networking for a special topic, SSH proxies, that is needed to attend W261 Machine Learning at Scale.

### LINUX
Most server infrastructure in use today is based in LINUX systems. MacOS too has a LINUX system at its core. Understanding the principles of this specific brand of operating systems and finding your way around in it is fundamental to this program. Many tools today abstract away the complexity of the underlying system but in order to debug a problem or create a new way of using modern tools will bring you back to digging deeper into LINUX.
The following EDX course is made and maintained by the LinuxFoundation.

To get extra practice the linux survival tutorial allows you to test your skill in an interactive, gamified way. This is optional: https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/

### Shell scripting
Shell scripting is part of each LINUX class and you probably have received your first practice going through the LINUX course. Being able to use Shell scripting in an efficient way has more to it than can be covered in a general LINUX class. A great and interactive way to learn it is 
on https://www.learnshell.org/

A concept usually not covered by basic scripting classes is HEREDOCS, you will need this in the advanced classes in this program: https://linuxhint.com/bash-heredoc-tutorial/

### SSH Proxies
SSH is briefly covered in the LINUX course. A specific use case for SSH are SSH proxies. The following tutorial covers this topic: https://daniel.haxx.se/docs/sshproxy.html
